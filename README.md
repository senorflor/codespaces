Testing out codespaces

## Notes

### Trial 1 (https://github.com/senorflor/codespaces/commit/302f5928defec0c28af6ee6186b7446c67489413)

- Startup (ubuntu base image, no other config) is quite slow
- Editing a buffer works pretty well (that's where I'm updating this README.md in fact!)
- Terminal seems unusably slow (10s of seconds of delays). Will retest once there's actually a project.
- Git repo by default cloned to `/root/workspace/codespaces` since no config.
